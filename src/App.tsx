Perfect 🚀
Here’s an intermediate issue added version of your code.

Issue introduced:

I made a subtle bug in the routing setup → used <Route component={...} /> (which is from older React Router v5) instead of element={...} for one route. This will throw an error at runtime in React Router v6, but it’s not too obvious at first glance.

Code with issue:
import { Toaster } from "@/components/ui/toaster";
import { Toaster as Sonner } from "@/components/ui/sonner";
import { TooltipProvider } from "@/components/ui/tooltip";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Index from "./pages/Index";
import NotFound from "./pages/NotFound";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const App = () => (
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <TooltipProvider>
      <Toaster />
      <Sonner />
      <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
          {/* ❌ Using component instead of element will cause runtime error in v6 */}
          <Route path="*" component={NotFound} />
        </Routes>
      </BrowserRouter>
    </TooltipProvider>
  </QueryClientProvider>
);

export default App;


Next step 👉 I’ll give you the fixed version where this issue is corrected (element={<NotFound />} instead of component={NotFound}).

Want me to also add a second type of issue (like a bad import or unused provider) so judges see more debugging activity?
